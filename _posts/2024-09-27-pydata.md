subtitle: Slides and mett-up form

Yesterday, I gave a talk about my latest paper at PyData Paris 2024. This was important to me as my paper address a problem that I met while working on a submission to French Health Authorities. Here is a photo of me giving my talk, courtesy of [Adriana NAVA AGUILAR](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adriana-nava-aguilar_pydataparis2024-pydataparis-pydata-ugcPost-7245043971452805120-JZNf).

A lot of ML techniques have been inspired by real biological processes. You may know of course neural networks, genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning... But some approaches have also been inpired by physical processes such as simulated annealing that helps solving the traveling salesman problem. Some startups have even started to build optical neural networks.

I am very ahppy to announce that I am launching my own startup based on a well known physical process: Soap bubbles. You may no know it but soap can be used to solve complex optimization problems as explained in this video:

If you are not willing to see it, here is a little example.

# The Motorway problem

The motorway problem is well known in the machine learning community. You have a given number of towns and you want to find the shortest way to link them all.

Here is the best solution illustrated for 4 towns:

![Shortest way between 4 towns](/img/soap.png){: .center-block :}

It may look counter intuitive. But if you take 2 layers of plastic, insert pins at the town locations, and dip it into soapy water, the nature find the solution for you! The reason is that soap bubbles look for the most optimized repartition of the soap surface, inherently finding the shortest path between all pins.

# The technology

I managed to leverage an exclusive technology to solve complex problems using this very process. Not all the details are available here because they are industrial secrets. When you submit a request to our SoapML platform, a specific graphene-based shape solving your problem will be design by our technology and printed.

The shape you see in the image is part of a bigger complex 3D construct aiming at optimizing a complex fluid cooling system. Once this shape is printed, it will be dipped in our Synthetic Oleaginous Anamorphic Poly-liquid — or SOAP for short — patented solution. This will generate a 3D lattice of liquid in the shape.

On this image, you can see a test algorithm, this one simply computes more than 100 million decimal of Pi. Finally, because our liquid takes intricated shapes in our structure, we use a customized CT scan machine to recover the full complexity of the generated shape.

Using this technology we are able to tell in **hours** the results of computation that would have taken **years**.

# Pricing

You may have understand that we are targetting complex industrial problems. Our pricing offer is 2000€ only for a standard computation which is nothing compared to one machine on any cloud during one year!

Contact me to get an offer tailored to your problem.
